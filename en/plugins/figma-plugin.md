# Indigo.Design Figma Plugin

The Indigo.Design Figma Plugin allows users to quickly create and publish apps in the Indigo.Cloud App Builder from their design.

Once you have created your design using the Indigo.Design UI kit library component, which can be downloaded from [here](https://www.figma.com/@infragistics) you can then export your design using the plugin.

It allows you to quickly create an app in Indigo.Design AppBuilder. This app follows the structure of the Figma design, mapping any symbol from the Indigo.Design UI kit to the corresponding component from Ignite UI. The plugin also takes the images used in XD and uploads them in the Assets library under AppBuilder, benefiting from [`Assets` support](https://www.infragistics.com/community/blogs/b/jason_beres/posts/indigo-design-app-builder-october-release-with-assets-support).  

## 1. Installing the Indigo.Design Figma plugin

The Indigo.Design Plugin is available after signing in to the [Indigo.Design Cloud](https://cloud.indigo.design). Go to the `Getting Started` menu and click the `GET INDIGO.DESIGN SYSTEM` button to open the assets dialog. Under the Figma tab you will be able to land on the Figma's Indigo.Design plugin page from where you can easily get the plugin. Or you can directly access it [here](https://www.figma.com/community/plugin/1170035114372031474).
