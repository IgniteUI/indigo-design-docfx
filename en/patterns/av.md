# Audio / Video

Use the AV Pattern to complement an audio or video track representation with playback controls.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/av_player_demo.png" srcset="../images/av_player_demo@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/av_volume_demo.png" srcset="../images/av_volume_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The AV Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Icon Buttons, Linear Progress Bar and text that shape its layout.
