# Hierarchical Grid

Use the Hierarchical Grid Pattern as a starting point when designing complex Grid hierarchies with nested children and various features for each of them. It provides a parent-grid and a nested child-grid with an active cell and visual representation of the relationship between the parent and child grids.

List of all the Grid functionality:
- Sorting
- Filtering
- Summaries
- Paging
- Editing
- Column Moving
- Column Resizing
- Column Hiding
- Display Density
- Excel Style Filtering
- GroupBy
- Pinning
- Row Selection
- Row Editing
- Active Cell
- Export
- Toolbar

All Grid features are applicable to each child and parent Grid.


> [!WARNING]
> After inserting the Hierarchical Grid Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components and Grid Features that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Components and Features, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
