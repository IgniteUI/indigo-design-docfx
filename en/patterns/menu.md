# Menu

Use the Menu Components as presets for building navigation bars for applications or webpages containing elements such as a logo, menu items, a search, various actions, and account settings among others.

## Types of Menus

There are two types of menus according to their orientation - Horizontal and Vertical.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/menu_horizontal.png" srcset="../images/menu_horizontal@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/menu_vertical.png" srcset="../images/menu_vertical@2x.png 2x" />
<div class="divider--half"></div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>
<div class="divider--half"></div>

Additionally, the menu patterns also offer variants based on the Navigation Drawer component and the Bottom Navigation Component.
