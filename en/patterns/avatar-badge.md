# Avatar + Badge

The Avatar + Badge Pattern is commonly used in many digital platforms to represent users and their accomplishments or roles. An Avatar is a small graphical representation of a user, often a profile picture or icon, while a Badge is a small visual element that is used with a short subtle message or indication to represent an achievement, alert or a status.

The Avatar + Badge Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and Badge that constitute its layout.

## Size

The Avatar + Badge Pattern supports the same sizes the Avatar does:

- Large - Suitable for profile pages
- Medium - Appropriate for custom menus and visualizations
- Small - Easily embedded in a contact list and similar repetitive scenarios
