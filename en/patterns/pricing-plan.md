# Pricing Table

Use the Pricing Table Pattern to display an offering for a product or a subscription. It comes in Featured and Not Featured presets including header, price, list of features included or not included and call-to-action button.

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting any of the Pricing Tables available as a Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Pricing Table Elements together with the background must stay intact and not be detached!
