# Image Manipulation

Use the Image Manipulation Pattern to provide a way to edit, update, modify, or perform other quick actions on an image or Avatar containing a photo.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/image-manip_demo.png" srcset="../images/image-manip_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The Image Manipulation Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and various Buttons that constitute its layout.

## Layout

The Image Manipulation Pattern supports both standard images and Avatars that come in layouts with one or two Flat Buttons or an Icon Button.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/image-manip_layout.png" srcset="../images/image-manip_layout@2x.png 2x" />
