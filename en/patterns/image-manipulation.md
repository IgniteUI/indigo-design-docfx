# Image Manipulation

Use the Image Manipulation Pattern to provide a way to edit, update, modify, or perform other quick actions on an image or Avatar containing a photo.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/image-manip_demo.png" srcset="../images/image-manip_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The Image Manipulation Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and various Buttons that constitute its layout.

## Layout

The Image Manipulation Pattern supports both standard images and Avatars that come in layouts with one or two Flat Buttons or an Icon Button.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/image-manip_layout.png" srcset="../images/image-manip_layout@2x.png 2x" />

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting an Image Manipulation Pattern you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` in order to be able to generate Angular code. The individual Components, however, must stay intact and not be detached!

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/image_manipulation_detach.png" srcset="../images/image_manipulation_detach@2x.png 2x" />
