# Footers

Use the Footer Pattern to display a website's complementary content such as site pages, a privacy policy, terms of service, social media links, subscription form, etc. in an unobtrusive and consistent way. Its content can be laid out vertically or horizontally and sits at the bottom of the page. Footer Patterns suitable for desktop and mobile device screen sizes are provided.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/footer_mobile_demo.png" srcset="../images/footer_mobile_demo@2x.png 2x" />

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting any of the Footer Patterns you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` in order to be able to generate the Pattern as Angular code. The various Components that lay it out must stay intact and not be detached!
