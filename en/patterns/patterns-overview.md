# Patterns Overview

The **Indigo.Design System** boosts your productivity with 180+ UI Patterns assembled from Indigo.Design Components. They are enhanced with the same responsive web design behavior and theming capabilities and can be found spread across the following pages of the library:

- ğŸŒ† AV Player
- ğŸŒ† Avatar + Badge
- ğŸŒ† Cards
- ğŸŒ† Chat
- ğŸŒ† Data Visualizations
- ğŸŒ† Details
- ğŸŒ† Dialogs
- ğŸŒ† Empty States
- ğŸŒ† File Upload
- ğŸŒ† Footer
- ğŸŒ† Form
- ğŸŒ† Grids
- ğŸŒ† Lists
- ğŸŒ† Menus
- ğŸŒ† Onboarding
- ğŸŒ† Pricing Table
- ğŸŒ† Scheduling
- ğŸŒ† Social Feed
- ğŸŒ† Tiles
- ğŸŒ† User Profile

Unlike a Component, every Pattern can be detached to show as a group, preserving the look and feel you have defined before that. Below is a snippet of some of the [list patterns](lists.md) such as a contacts list, searchable and filterable lists, and list empty states when no matching results are found.

We constantly improve our patterns by adding new ones. To identify changes more easily from one release of the **Indigo.Design System** to the next, you will notice that we append a ğŸ†• emoji to the pages containing updates. You may also create your own Patterns from interface layouts that you use over and over again in your designs, extending our default set and giving your design productivity a further boost.
