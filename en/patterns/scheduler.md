# Scheduler

Use the Scheduler Pattern as a preset to display a scheduler as part of project management, task management, meeting planner, or e-mail application. Note that the Scheduler Pattern is just an interface illustrating a scheduler without any of the scheduling functionality.

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting the Scheduler Pattern you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` in order to be able to generate the Pattern as Angular code. The various Components that lay it out must stay intact and not be detached!
