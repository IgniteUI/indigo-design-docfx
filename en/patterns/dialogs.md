# Dialogs

Use the Dialog Patterns to alert the users or give them relevant information for an error or a system state that requires urgent input or action. They are usually triggered by a user's action and should be displayed over the main content. Dialogs should be used sparingly as they interrupt the user in his experience with the product.

The Dialog Patterns come with the styling flexibility provided by the Buttons, Inputs, and List elements that constitute their layout.

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting a Dialog Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Components, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
