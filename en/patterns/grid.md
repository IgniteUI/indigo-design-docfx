# Grid

Use any of the Grid Pattern symbols as an alternative starting point when designing a tabular data layout. It provides a full-blown contentwise and stylewise Grid Component, on which all the Grid functionality, provided in the Components Library can be applied.

The Grid Pattern with Excel Style Filter, Sorting and Display Density is shown below:

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting the Grid Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components and Grid Features that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Components and Features, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
