# Checkbox Group

Use the Checkbox Group Pattern to organize and layout a collection of Checkbox elements as a group, e.g. to contain the answers for a multiple choice question.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox-group_demo.png" srcset="../images/checkbox-group_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The Checkbox Group Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Checkbox elements that constitute it.

> [!WARNING]
> In Figma to add more Checkbox items than provided you should right-click on an instance of the Checkbox Group pattern and then select "Detach instance". To add more items, simply duplicate one of the existing ones and the applied auto layout will adjust the nested Checkbox components accordingly.
