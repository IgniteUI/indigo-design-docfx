# File Upload

Use the File Upload Pattern to provide the uploading and insertion mechanisms for files, images, or attachments.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/file-upload_demo.png" srcset="../images/file-upload_demo@2x.png 2x" />

The File Upload Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and Icon Button that constitute its layout.

The File Upload Pattern provides two types of previews for the uploaded file: an Avatar and a Document, shown in a standard image.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/file-upload_type.png" srcset="../images/file-upload_type@2x.png 2x" />
