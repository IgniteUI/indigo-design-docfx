# Tree Grid

Use the Tree Grid Pattern as an alternative starting point when designing a tabular data layout with parent-child relationship between the records. It provides a full-blown contentwise and stylewise Tree Grid Component, on which all the Grid functionality, provided in the Components Library can be applied.

List of all the Grid functionality:
- Sorting
- Filtering
- Summaries
- Paging
- Editing
- Column Moving
- Column Resizing
- Column Hiding
- Display Density
- Excel Style Filtering
- GroupBy
- Pinning
- Row Selection
- Row Editing
- Active Cell
- Export
- Toolbar

All Grid features are applicable to the Tree Grid Pattern.


> [!WARNING]
> After inserting the Tree Grid Pattern, you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` to break it down to the Components and Grid Features that are used to create the layout in order to be able to generate it as Angular code. The individual Components and Features, however, must stay intact and not be detached!
