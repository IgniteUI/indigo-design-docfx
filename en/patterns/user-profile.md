# User Profile

Use the User Profile Pattern to display user-related information, either as a full-screen detailed page or as a small indication that can be inserted in headers and toolbars.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/profile_demo.png" srcset="../images/profile_demo@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/profile_small.png" srcset="../images/profile_small@2x.png 2x" />

An editable variant of the User Profile Pattern, nicely laid out with the appropriate Inputs, is also provided. The User Profile Pattern comes with the styling flexibility provided by the Avatar and Inputs that constitute its layout.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/edit_profile_demo.png" srcset="../images/edit_profile_demo@2x.png 2x" />

> [!WARNING]
> After inserting any of the User Profile Patterns you should trigger `Detach from Symbol` in order to be able to generate the Pattern as Angular code. The various Components that lay it out must stay intact and not be detached!

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/profile_detach.png" srcset="../images/profile_detach@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/edit_profile_detach.png" srcset="../images/edit_profile_detach@2x.png 2x" />
