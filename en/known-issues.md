# Known Issues

This topic describes the issues and limitations we have run into or observed when using the Indigo Design Libraries in Figma, Sketch and AdobeXD. Where applicable we will be providing the necessary guidance to avoid the occurrence of issues or recover from them once they occur.

### General

#### Detached Symbols

As you may have already seen in the other topics detaching or ungrouping symbols usually results in the loss of capability for code generation. However, a few components like the List and the Grid are basically repeaters of items and cells and come in a more generic form that is supposed to be detached to allow you to create the number of items, rows and columns that you would need. As we enhance individual items with functionality in the upcoming versions of the libraries, such updates should propagate easily, however enhancements made to the collection of items i.e. `List/One-line Item List` or `Grid/Comfortable`, for example, will not propagate to the detached instances of these components.

While `Detach from Symbol` is something you may eventually resort to in Figma and Sketch, with Adobe XD remember that you can even add/remove layers in instances of a symbol. This is especially useful when content is templatable e.g. in a list item you may want to add a Chip, which is not there in any of the template options.

> [!Note]
> When detaching component, that component won't receive updates, if the UI Kit is updated or when a library is swapped.

#### User input in components

User input values of components which change per scenario are not generated. Some examples of these components would be checkbox (checked state), radio group (selected state), switch, etc.


#### Not supported Stroke styles
Currently not supported stroke styles are:
- Corner radius
- Stroke per side
- Dashed style settings
  - Dash
  - Gap
  - Cap type
- Join type
- Mitter angle

##### Not supported Effects styles
Currently not supported effects styles are:
- Inner shadow
- Layer blur
- Background blur

#### Non-resizable components
Some components apply limitation on what size they or their direct children can take.
As such resizing them in the design will have no affect on the generated result as they are considered non-resizable.

Components that are non-resizable include:

- Avatar - has only 3 preset sizes in the design library. Resizing it to a custom size is not supported.
- Dialog - takes the size of its content. Cannot be individually resized.
- Radio - takes the size of its content. Cannot be individually resized.
- Snackbar - takes the size of the container. Cannot be individually resized.
- Button children (Icon and Text) - They are determined by the typography and do not allow resizing.
- Repeatable child elements, which are inside a parent component, like:
  - List Items
  - NavDrawer Items
  - Buttons in Button group
  - etc.
  Those items are determined by the parent size and cannot be individually resized.

### Figma
#### Main Components
Currently Main Components are skipped by the parser, you can copy a Main Component in the page to make it an instance and now it will be read by the parsers. Using Main Components in your design might occur if you copy directly components from the UI Kit and not load the library and take them from the assets panel.

#### Colors
The UI Kit provides `surface-light` and `surface-dark` colors, and importing these colors in AppBuilder will result in single `Surface` color, which might be light or dark depending on the chosen theme.

#### Crop image size in Figma
As you already know images are retrieved from the design application as assets. The size of the image is determined in the Figma design. At the moment `CROP` size is not supported.

#### Not supported elements
The following Figma components are not implemented for code generation yet:

  - Shapes
    - Line
    - Arrow
    - Polygon
    - Star
  - Pen
  - Pencil

> [!Note]
> Future releases will include these components.

### Sketch
#### Images and Code Generation
In Sketch, there are two ways to insert images:

1.  Drag & drop an image onto an artboard
2.  Draw a Rectangle and set its Fill to be an image

Both of these are supported however the image will be generated with the dimensions defined in the Sketch file, and will not be responsive.

Images that were created using the first method above and are used as backgrounds will not be code generated as a background but as a normal image element.

Images that were created using the second method above and are used as backgrounds will be code generated as a background.

> [!Note]
> A future release will feature an Image Component that will generate code for responsive images.

#### Illustrations and Code Generation
At the moment we support Illustrations only at design time and once you proceed to generate Angular code from your design, they will be skipped. However, if you still want to have the key visual as a code asset, you may export it as a PNG and insert it in your design file as an image.

> [!Note]
> A future release will handle Illustrations as SVG files in order to render them correctly with the colors applied as a theme.

#### Not supported elements

The following Sketch components are not implemented for code generation yet:
  - Shapes
    - Line
    - Arrow
    - Star
    - Polygon
    - Triangle
  - Vector
  - Pencil
  - Mask
  - Elevation

#### Getting Invalid Overrides

When using nested symbols to customize the look and feel of a Component, we have discovered that sometimes after tweaking overrides deep in the nesting hierarchy and then changing an override above with a different underlying structure, Sketch gets confused and assigns values to this structure that are by no means appropriate for or matching it.

If you run in such a situation, just make sure that you pick the correct value for each on the underlying overrides and leave the Component in a valid state. Otherwise, it will not only reflect an impossible configuration, but will be impossible to comprehend by our code generation engine.

### AdobeXD
#### Change of Layer Name
When using nested symbols to customize the look and feel of a Component, we have discovered that sometimes after dragging an alternative symbol to replace the default one, Adobe XD may also change its name e.g. from `ðŸ”£ Icon` to `_Overrides/Material Icons/action/account_circle`.

If you run into this type of situation, just make sure to use the original name of the layer to make sure it does not get skipped by the code generation engine.
