## Creating Your First Artboard

At the end of this topic you'll have a Sketch Artboard for a registration screen using the **Indigo.Design System**.

## What you need

If the [Titillium Web Font][1] isn't installed on your computer, please do it before starting. All texts in the **Indigo.Design System** use it.

## Step by step

### 1. Add the **Indigo.Design System** in Sketch.

1.  Download the [**Indigo.Design System**](https://cloud.indigo.design/home).

    It contains a Sketch file with 26 Pages in the Pages section which are distinguished by three types of icons:

    - **🎨 ~** styling pages: all the styling assets such as Material Icons, Colors, Typography, Elevation, and Illustrations can be found in the five pages on top.

    - **🧩 Components**  page: a vast set of Components to layout your design ideas.
      Through various presets available in the Sketch insert menu and overrides for states and layouts to configure in the right panel of the Sketch UI, you can create layouts compatible with Ignite UI for Angular and our code generation engine.

    - **🌆 ~** patterns pages: the components shape up meaningful patterns for productive application design that can be found spread across the remaining pages.

2.  Open up the Sketch app on your Mac, click on the Sketch item from the Apple Menu, and select Preferences.

3.  In the dialog, select the **Libraries** tab and click the **Add Library...** button.

4.  Navigate to the folder where you have downloaded the library.

5.  Select it and click **Open**.

6.  Make sure it shows up in the list in the **Preferences** dialog and that it is checked.

  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>

You may have noticed that in the image above, the library also appears to be present in my Sketch cloud, and as an alternative, you can use this mechanism in Sketch if you are running version 57 or later. The set up is very easy, you only need to open the Indigo.Design Sketch file and save it in your Sketch cloud. A detailed explanation of how to set Indigo.Design as a cloud library can be found in [this Medium post](https://medium.com/ignite-ui/using-indigo-design-with-sketch-cloud-libraries-70533bca00f8). Once you added the library successfully, it will show up in the **Symbols** section of the **Insert** menu in Sketch.

### 2. Create an artboard.

1.  In the Sketch app on your Mac, create a new file.
2.  Select the Artboard size.  
    Press the `A` key and select the artboard size from the panel on the right.  
    This example is for an iPhone 11 in portrait orientation (414x896). If you don't see this preset artboard, choose Apple Devices from the dropdown at the top of the panel.

  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <img class="responsive-img" src="images/getting-started-artboard.png" srcset="images/getting-started-artboard@2x.png" />
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>
  <div class="divider--half"></div>

### 3. Add and customize components.

We will use the **Insert** menu to add components from the Indigo Design Library, and then customize them using the panel on the right.

These are the steps to recreate the screen in the example.

1.  **Add the Navbar.**

    1.  From the **Insert** menu, select Symbols / Indigo.Design / Navigation / Navbar / Elevated.
    2.  Place it at the top of the artboard and stretch it to take up all the width available.
    3.  In the Resizing section of the panel on the right, pin it to the top of the artboard and fix its height.
    4.  In the Overrides section, set the Left Action to ~No Symbol, then set the Title to "Sign Up". After that set the 1 | Icon, 2 | Icon, and 3 | Icon to ~No Symbol.

    <div class="divider--half"></div>
    <img class="responsive-img" src="images/getting-started0.png" srcset="images/getting-started0@2x.png 2x" />
    <div class="divider--half"></div>

2.  **Add the background color.**  
     Press the `R` key and drag а rectangular shape, making sure it's sized accordingly to fill the available area below the Navbar and is also under it as a layer. With the rectangle selected, in the right panel under Appearance you will find a Layer Style dropdown. Open it and choose Indigo.Design / Color / Fill / primary.100.
