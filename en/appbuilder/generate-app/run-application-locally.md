# Run Application Locally

> [!NOTE]
><b>The application files can be downloaded as a package and then run in your preferred IDE.

### Run the app locally
To finally develop the app, you don't need to copy and paste code. Instead, use the generate app button in the toolbar. This quickly creates a package with your Angular application that can be downloaded. To run this app, open up the folder in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 

* Make sure you have Node.js installed. <br>
* Then in the console, type `npm install` to install the dependencies. It may take a while to install all the necessary packages. <be>
* Once that is done, type `npm start` to compile and launch the app.<br>

With the ability to create your designs visually using professional grade components in the editor, and then being able to generate an Angular app you can freely extend in your IDE offers you the best of both worlds. In the end, you are guaranteed that what you designed is exactly how it looks when the app is built. Don't forget to share your feedback using the feedback button. We look forward to hearing about your experience and also about what features are valuable to you as we move forwards to our next release milestone in the coming months.
