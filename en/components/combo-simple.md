# Simple Combo

Use the Simple Combo component to allow users to select an option from a predefined list of choices or enter their own value. When the user clicks on the drop-down arrow, a drop down list of options is displayed, and they can either select one of the options or search for an value into the text box. The Combo is visually identical to the [ Ignite UI for Angular Single Select ComboBox Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/simple-combo.html)

## Simple Combo Demo

The Combo has two pieces: an input containing the current selection and a drop down that is shown in order to select an option from a predefined dropdown list.
