# Grid Column Moving

Use the Grid Column Moving to indicate that the columns of the Grid are movable and can be rearranged by dragging the Header Cell and dropping it to the desired location. The Grid Column Moving is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Column Moving Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/column_moving.html)

## Header Cell

The Grid Column Moving as a header cell feature has been deprecated in Figma and if you are using AppBuilder to generate your design, you should apply it directly there after the code generation.

## Column Moving Feature

The Grid has a `Column Moving` component under `Features` that represents the ghost Header Cell shown for the dragged column. It comes with presets for numeric and text columns. Adding this component has only a visual effect on your design to make it look more realistic.
