# Button Group

Use the Button Group Component to combine the triggers for a few related features into one interface element. The Button Group is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Button Group Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/button-group.html)

## Button Group Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/button-group_demo.png" srcset="../images/button-group_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Layout

The Button Group supports two layout directions: horizontal, where items are laid out left to right, and vertical, where their order is top to bottom.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/button-group_horizontal.png" srcset="../images/button-group_horizontal@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/button-group_vertical.png" srcset="../images/button-group_vertical@2x.png 2x" />

## Buttons Amount

The Button Group uses smart layouting options to let you choose the exact amount of buttons that you need and hide the extra ones by setting them to ~No Symbol from the overrides panel.

## Button Layout Template

Each Button in the Button Group is a Flat Button and allows for the same degree of templating.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/button-group_text.png" srcset="../images/button-group_text@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/button-group_icon.png" srcset="../images/button-group_icon@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Button Group comes with styling flexibility through the various options controlling the border and background color, as well as the individual buttons' outline, background, text, and icon colors.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/button-group_styling.png" srcset="../images/button-group_styling@2x.png 2x" />

## Usage

Always use Buttons with consistent style and avoid combining text Buttons with icon Buttons within the same Button Group. Size the Button Group according to its content to avoid leaving too much empty space in the Buttons. Use the Button Group only to display simple and related actions, as it is not suitable for even simple navigation. If you're looking beyond these actions, [Tabs](tabs.md) are much more appropriate.
