# Hyperlink

Use the Hyperlink Component to allow the user access additional information related to a styled piece of text in a paragraph like the mentioning of the Terms of Use or the Privacy Policy in a form.

## Hyperlink Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/hyperlink_demo.png" srcset="../images/hyperlink_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Size

The Hyperlink comes in two different sizes matching the available sizes for paragraph text: Body 1 and Body 2.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/hyperlink_sizes.png" srcset="../images/hyperlink_sizes@2x.png 2x" />

## Url

Specify the link you want the hyperlink to open when clicked via the Url override. This will have no visibility in your design but will be taken into account by the code generation services.

## Styling

The Hyperlink can be styled by changing the default blue color of the text of the `Symbol Master` that can be found on the ðŸ§© Components page in the Indigo.Design library.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/hyperlink_styling.png" srcset="../images/hyperlink_styling@2x.png 2x" />

## Usage

Always choose a Hyperlink text color that makes it stand out in a paragraph. Avoid using the same color or similar nuances of it and pick a consistent color across your complete design.
