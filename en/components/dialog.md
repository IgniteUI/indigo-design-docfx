# Dialog

Use the Dialog Component to show a message or alert to the user, allowing him to take action accordingly or to present a form that requires immediate action before proceeding, such as a login. The Dialog is displayed modally, meaning that the user has to complete or close it before moving on. The Dialog is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Dialog Window Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/dialog.html)

## Dialog Demo

## Types

The Dialog can be used to show an alert with only a confirming button, a message with cancellation and confirmation, or as a container for action that needs immediate attention, such as a user logging into his account. The Button area is templatable, allowing you, for example, to hide a button. To hide a button in Sketch, you have to set its override to ~No Symbol, and through the use of a smart layout, it will adjust accordingly. While in Adobe XD, you have to delete the unused layer instead, and the layout will adjust through the use of stacks.

## Styling

The Dialog comes with styling flexibility through the various options for its title and message, the buttons at the bottom with all the styling options that [Button](button.md) component provides, as well as the background and elevation.

## Usage

When designing a custom Dialog, avoid placing buttons in the body section and use the existing dialog buttons for your actions instead.

| Do                            | Don't                           |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
