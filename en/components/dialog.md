# Dialog

Use the Dialog Component to show a message or alert to the user, allowing him to take action accordingly or to present a form that requires immediate action before proceeding, such as a login. The Dialog is displayed modally, meaning that the user has to complete or close it before moving on. The Dialog is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Dialog Window Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/dialog.html)

## Dialog Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/dialog_demo.png" srcset="../images/dialog_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Types

The Dialog can be used to show an alert with only a confirming button, a message with cancellation and confirmation, or as a container for action that needs immediate attention, such as a user logging into his account.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/dialog_custom.png" srcset="../images/dialog_custom@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Dialog comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides for its title and message, the buttons at the bottom with all the styling options that [Button](button.md) component provides, as well as the background and elevation.

## Usage

When designing a custom Dialog, avoid placing buttons in the body section and use the existing dialog buttons for your actions instead.

| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| <img class="responsive-img" src="../images/dialog_do1.png" srcset="../images/dialog_do1@2x.png 2x" /> | <img class="responsive-img" src="../images/dialog_dont1.png" srcset="../images/dialog_dont1@2x.png 2x" /> |
