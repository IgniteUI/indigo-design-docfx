# Grid Sorting

Use Grid Sorting to indicate the ordering of records in ascending and descending order according to the values within a given column. The Grid Sorting is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Sorting Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/sorting.html)

## Header Cell Feature

In Figma, to indicate a column as sortable, use either the `Feature Left` or `Feature Right` component instance, located inside the Grid Header Cell layer, and set the `Type` property to Sorting Ascending, Sorting Descending, or **Sorting Unsorted** to indicate the sort order. Of course, you would probably want to manipulate the column values to reflect the selected ordering.
