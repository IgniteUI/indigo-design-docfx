# Grid Sorting

Use Grid Sorting to indicate the ordering of records in ascending and descending order according to the values within a given column. The Grid Sorting is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Sorting Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/sorting.html)

## Header Cell Feature

In order to indicate a column as sortable use either the `Feature Left` or `Feature Right` overrides and set it to `Sorting`. Then you can set the `Sorting State` to Ascending, Descending, or **Unsorted** to indicate the sort order. Of course, you would probably want to manipulate the column values to reflect the selected ordering.
