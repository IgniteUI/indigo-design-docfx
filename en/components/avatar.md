# Avatar

The Avatar component is used as a graphical representation of a person, featuring options like a profile picture or image, an icon, or a string with initials. The Avatar is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Avatar Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/avatar.html)

## Usage

When using an Avatar with initials or icons, ensure their colors contrast well with the Avatarâ€™s background. Avoid low-contrast combinations, such as similar shades of the same color or those that cause chromatic aberrations.
