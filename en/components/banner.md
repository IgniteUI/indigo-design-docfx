# Banner

Use the Banner Component to display a prominent message and optionally actions related to it. The Banner is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Banner Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/banner)

## Banner Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/banner_demo.png" srcset="../images/banner_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Message

The Banner's Message consists of an Icon and a Text field. In Figma, you can use the "Icon" boolean operation from the properties panel to show/hide the Icon.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/banner_message.png" srcset="../images/banner_message@2x.png 2x" />

## Actions

The Actions area contains two Button components by default. In Figma, to manage the actions displayed in the Banner, you can choose which one to keep and hide the other from the layers panel or hide the entire actions container using the "Actions" boolean operation.

## Styling

The Banner has styling flexibility with options for text, background and border colors, icon glyph and color, as well as the types of buttons with their styling options.

## Usage

Illustrations are used to support the message. Don't use them without a descriptive text to promote the action. Donâ€™t combine buttons with different emphasis, which would promote one action over the other.
