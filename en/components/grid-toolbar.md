# Grid Toolbar

Use the Grid Toolbar to define actions that affect the appearance and behavior of the whole grid. By default, the Toolbar will contain actions for showing/hiding and pinning/unpinning of columns, as well as Exporting the Grid content in various formats. The Grid Toolbar is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Toolbar Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/toolbar.html)

## Grid Toolbar Demo

## Layout

The Grid Toolbar uses `Smart Layout` in Sketch and has interchangeable default and custom actions, which gives absolute freedom to change its content and layout. If you want to hide an action, you have to set it to ~No Symbol. In Adobe XD, you have to delete the unused layers instead, and the layout will adjust through the use of stacks.

## Styling

The Grid Toolbar comes with styling flexibility through the various options for its Actions, as well as its title style and background color.
