# Grid Toolbar

Use the Grid Toolbar to define actions that affect the appearance and behavior of the whole grid. By default, the Toolbar will contain actions for showing/hiding and pinning/unpinning of columns, as well as Exporting the Grid content in various formats. The Grid Toolbar is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Toolbar Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/toolbar.html)

## Grid Toolbar Demo

## Layout

The Grid Toolbar uses smart layout in Sketch and auto layout in Figma and it has interchangeable default and custom actions, which gives absolute freedom to change its content and layout. If you want to hide an action, in Sketch you have to set it to ~No Symbol, as in Figma you can just hide the action you don't need. The layout will adjust dynamically. To do so in Adobe XD, you have to delete the unnecessary actions, and the layout will adjust thanks to the use of a Stack.

The Grid Toolbar comes with styling flexibility through the various options for its Actions, as well as its title style and background color.
