# Grid Toolbar

Use the Grid Toolbar to define actions that affect the appearance and behavior of the whole grid. By default, the Toolbar will contain actions for showing/hiding and pinning/unpinning of columns, as well as Exporting the Grid content in various formats. The Grid Toolbar is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Toolbar Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/toolbar.html)
