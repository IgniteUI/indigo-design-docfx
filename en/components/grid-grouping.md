# Grid Group By

Use Grid Group By to organize data records in a hierarchical collection of groups defined by the matching values within a given column. The order of Group By conditions is represented in a special area above the Grid Header and special rows are inserted between Grid records to mark the beginning of a new group. The Grid Group By is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Group By Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/groupby.html)

## Grid Group By Demo

## Group Area

The Grid has a `Group Area` symbol under `Features` that specifies the columns that are used to establish the hierarchical grouping of records and the order in which these groups will be nested. Once you insert it in Sketch, you may perform `Detach from Symbol`, and inside you will find a [Chips Area](chips.md) that can be configured in a way that defines how Group By is applied on the Grid. In Adobe XD there is no need to detach.

## GroupBy Row

The Grid has a `GroupBy Row` symbol under `Features` that represents a special row in the Grid that is like a heading preceding the grouped records with some summary information about their amount within the group. Adding this symbol has only a visual effect on your design to make it more realistic. To switch the GroupBy feature on, insert and configure a `Group Area`.
