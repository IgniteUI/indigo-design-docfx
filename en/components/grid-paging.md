# Grid Paging

Use Grid Paging to inform the user about his current position (on which Grid page the user is currently on) and allow navigation to the previous/next and first/last pages of the Grid content. Position the Grid Paging immediately below the Grid without any gap between the two. The Grid Paging is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Paging Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid_paging.html)
