# Checkbox

Use the Checkbox Component to allow the user make a selection, which most often expresses a preference or agreement in a form. The Checkbox is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Checkbox Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/checkbox.html)

## Checkbox Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_demo.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Interaction State

The checkbox can be inserted in an enabled or disabled state.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_interaction_state.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_interaction_state@2x.png 2x" />

## Theme

The Checkbox can be used styled in **dark** and light variants to assure good readability and contrast for both lighter and darker backgrounds.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_dark.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_dark@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_light.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_light@2x.png 2x" />

## Layout Template

The checkbox supports a label position where the Checkbox label is placed after or before the Checkbox box element.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_label_after.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_label_after@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_label_before.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_label_before@2x.png 2x" />

## State

The Checkbox provides **on**, off, and indeterminate selection states.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_selection.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_selection@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Checkbox comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling its check and fill colors, as well as the label position and its color.

## Usage

When many Checkboxes are necessary, you'll want to arrange them in a column group which makes it really easy to scan quickly through the list. Fewer Checkboxes may also be arranged on a single line next to each other but you should avoid arrangements in multiple columns.
