# Checkbox

Use the Checkbox Component to allow the user make a selection, which most often expresses a preference or agreement in a form. The Checkbox is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Checkbox Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/checkbox.html)

## Checkbox Demo

## Interaction State

The checkbox can be inserted in an Enabled or Disabled state. In Figma, you can additionally apply a single or a combination of the following properties: Hover, Focused and Invalid, which can be switched in the properties panel.

## Layout Template
 
 In Figma, you can change the label's position by using the "Label Position" property.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/checkbox_label_before.png" srcset="../images/checkbox_label_before@2x.png 2x" />

## State

The Checkbox provides **On**, Off, and Indeterminate selection states. In Figma, you can switch the selection state using the "State" property from the properties panel.

## Styling

The Checkbox comes with styling flexibility through the various options for its check and fill colors, as well as mechanisms to set a label position and color.

## Usage

When many Checkboxes are necessary, you'll want to arrange them in a column group which makes it really easy to scan quickly through the list. Fewer Checkboxes may also be arranged on a single line next to each other but you should avoid arrangements in multiple columns.
