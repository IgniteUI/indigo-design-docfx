# Column Chart

 The Column Chart is among the most common chart types used to quickly compare frequency, count, total, or average of data in different categories with data encoded by vertical bars of equal width and differing heights. They are ideal for showing variations in the value of an item over time. Data is represented using a collection of rectangles that extend from the bottom to the top of the chart towards the values of data points.

## Column Chart Demo

The Column Chart comprises of `Title`, a `Legend` that is hidden by default, and `Chart Area` available in Idle and Hover states.

## Title

The Column Chart has a title that can be changed or hidden if not needed. In Sketch, the applied smart layout rules allow the layout to adjust accordingly when you want to hide the title and set it to ~No Symbol. In Adobe XD, the use of stacks lets you achieve that by deleting the unused layer instead.

## State

The Column Chart has two states - Idle and Hover. In Sketch this is achieved with `Symbol Overrides`, while in Adobe XD we are using the `Component States` paradigm to let you easily switch between states. In the Hover state a tooltip is shown upon hovering over a data point, which is then focused and the other columns are dimmed out.

## Y-Axis

The Y-axis of the column chart comprises of a Title, Labels, and the Axis itself. The Title and the Labels are configurable and to hide a label simply set its override to ~No Symbol in Sketch or delete the layer in Adobe XD. You may hide the axis line by setting its color to `Transparent` and to hide all elements at once, change the Y-axis override to ~No Symbol in Sketch or delete the layer in Adobe XD.

## Gridlines

The Column Chart has built-in Gridlines to make it easier to visually trace a data point to a value on the Y-axis. To hide them just set their color to `Transparent`.

## Data Points

Data Points for a Column Chart are the individual columns, which use a `Smart Layout` in Sketch, making it possible to adjust accordingly their amount on the Chart Area. In Adobe XD, the use of `Stacks` lets you achieve that. They come with configurable labels on the X-axis and annotation labels.

## Styling

First and foremost, the Column Chart lets you change the color of the series. It is recommended to use only colors from the palette for data visualizations with nuances named series.1, series.2 and so on till series.10. You may also change the colors of the vertical and horizontal axis, the gridlines, as well as the chart area background and border colors. Titles, labels, annotation values etc. are also customizable via the available text styles in the **Indigo.Design System**.

## Usage

Use the Column Chart when you want to show the amount of change over a period of time. Always start your numeric Axis at 0 to avoid misrepresenting the data. Also, avoid using different colors for the same category. If referencing time, e.g. dates or months, to represent the change in the category, you should always set it on the horizontal axis. Use subtle colors for the Gridlines to make the chart easier on the eye. If you need a more detailed time series visual, consider using a Line Chart instead.
