## Accordion

The Accordion component allows users to progressively reveal content in a vertical stack. It typically consists of a list of [Expansion Panels](expansion-panel.md), where each item can be expanded or collapsed to reveal or hide its content. Accordions are often used to manage a large amount of information in a compact space, and to allow users to selectively focus on specific pieces of information. The Accordion is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Accordion Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/accordion)
