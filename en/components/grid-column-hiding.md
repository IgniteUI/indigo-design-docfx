# Grid Column Hiding

Use the Grid Column Hiding to hide certain columns from the Grid. The easiest way to provide an interface for making columns visible again is by adding a Toolbar, which by default contains a button (combined with combo) that lets you configure the visibility of columns for the whole grid. The Grid Column Hiding is identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Column Hiding Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/column_hiding.html)

## Toolbar and Header Cell

The Grid Column Hiding can be achieved by adding a Toolbar with a Column Hiding action that enables the feature for the whole grid. However, in order to mark certain columns as hidable, you need to configure the `Column Hiding` override on the Grid Header Cell for the respective column and set it to Hidden. The override's default value is **Visible**.
