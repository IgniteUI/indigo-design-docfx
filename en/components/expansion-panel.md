# Expansion Panel

Use the Expansion Panel Component as a way to preserve screen-space, where you have a lot of text and would like to hide it with the title in the Header giving initial information, and when opened, the Body's content giving more details. The Expansion Panel has two main states - Collapsed (Active and Disabled) and Expanded.
The Expansion Panel is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Expansion Panel Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/expansion-panel.html)

## Expansion Panel Demo

## Header State

The Expansion Panel's Header comes in two states - Active (Default) and Disabled. You can switch between them in Overrides panel in Sketch and the Component Layout in Adobe XD.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/expansion_panel_disabled.png" srcset="../images/expansion_panel_disabled@2x.png 2x" />

## Header Layout

The Expansion Panel's Header Layout consists of Left Expansion Panel Icon, Content - Title and Description, and a Right Expansion Panel Icon. Each of the icons can be hidden by setting their state to ~No Symbol in the Overrides panel in Sketch, or hiding the layer in Adobe XD. The Left Expansion Panel Icon and the Content are in a smart layout in Sketch, or Stack in Adobe XD, meaning that if the Icon is hidden, the Content will automatically shift to the left, where the Icon was, making the layout visually appealing.

## Body

The Expansion Panel's Body is the text field of the Expanded state.

## Styling

The Expansion Panel comes with options for changing the both the Header and Body's background colors, text colors and icons' colors.
