# Avatar

Use the Avatar Component as a graphical representation of a person through a profile picture or image, an icon, or a string with initials. The Avatar is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Avatar Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/avatar.html)

## Avatar Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/avatar_demo.png" srcset="../images/avatar_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Size

The Avatar comes in three different sizes:

- Large - Suitable for profile pages
- Medium - Appropriate for custom menus and visualizations
- Small - Easily embedded in a contact list and similar repetitive scenarios

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/avatar_sizes.png" srcset="../images/avatar_sizes@2x.png 2x" />

## Type

The Avatar can carry different types of content such as an **image**, a string with initials, or an icon.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/avatar_content.png" srcset="../images/avatar_content@2x.png 2x" />

The avatar comes in two distinct types determined by its shape: a **round** and a square form.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/avatar_type.png" srcset="../images/avatar_type@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Avatar comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling the background color, as well as initials and icon colors, where applicable.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/avatar_styling.png" srcset="../images/avatar_styling@2x.png 2x" />

## Usage

When using an Avatar with initials or icons, pick their colors carefully to assure good contrast with the Avatar background color. Avoid colors with poor contrast like similar shades of the same color or combinations that create chromatic aberrations.

## Code Generation

When colors or fonts are specified for the Avatar, the Avatar HTML element will be wrapped in div. This is required by browsers to style a nested component (a component within another component).

> [!WARNING]
> Triggering `Detach from Symbol` on an instance of the Avatar in your design is very likely to result in loss of code generation capability for the Avatar.

### Data Bindings

Data bindings are specified by using curly brace syntax, example: {isAdmin}. Data bindings can be non-nested or nested. If the target property is a nested property, include the nested property chain, but don‚Äôt include the model object name. Examples:

#### Not Nested

```typescript
Customer {
  imageName: String;
}
```

DataProperty would be: `{imageName}`

#### Nested

```typescript
Profile {
  imageName: String;
}

Customer {
  profile: Profile;
}
```

DataProperty would be: `{profile.imageName}`

### Event Property

When supplied, this property is used to create a method in the component TypeScript and add an Angular click signature in the HTML. When supplied the event must be specified using the curly braces format: {onEventName}

### Data Property

| Picture Avatar  | When supplied, this property can be used to data bind the image source. When provided, it will be the name of the property on the data object specified by the model object name provided during code generation.                                                                                     |
