# Carousel

Use the Carousel Component to let the user navigate through a collection of images in a sequential fashion, moving to the previous/next one through the arrows on the sides. The Carousel is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Carousel Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/carousel.html)

## Carousel Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/carousel_demo.png" srcset="../images/carousel_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Indicators and Slides

The Carousel lets you define up to 10 slides, where for each one there is a matching indicator dot, allowing the user to navigate to that respective slide.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/carousel_indicators&slides.png" srcset="../images/carousel_indicators&slides@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Carousel comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling the navigation buttons background and icon colors, the indicator colors, border colors, and the slide image for the currently active slide, along with the elevation and state where applicable. You should keep in mind that only one indicator may be active at a time.

## Usage

The previous and next navigation buttons of the Carousel should always appear on top of the image slide, and the indicators should have consistent styling, where only the active one should be emphasized.
