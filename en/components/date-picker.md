# Date Picker

Use the Date Picker Component to represent a date visually and provide appropriate means for its display in forms and selection from a drop-down or dialog. The Date Picker is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Date Picker Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/date_picker.html)

## Date Picker Demo

## Date Picker Input

You may insert a Date Picker Input in your forms to indicate fields for selecting a date. It supports Enabled and Disabled interactive states, as well as variant for Dialog and Drop-down that will be shown upon user interaction.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/datepicker_disabled.png" srcset="../images/datepicker_disabled@2x.png 2x" />

## Picker Layout

The Date Picker supports Dialog layout with Horizontal and Vertical orientation, as well as a Drop-down layout to facilitate different modes of picking dates. Notice that Dialog layouts come with a Header that you may hide by setting its override to ~No Symbol, but still the shadow it casts allows to distinguish it from a Drop-down layout.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/datepicker_vertical.png" srcset="../images/datepicker_vertical@2x.png 2x" />

## Week Start

The start of the week can also be chosen as an option at the time of inserting a Date Picker between the two most common scenarios for first day of the week: Sunday and Monday.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/datepicker_monday.png" srcset="../images/datepicker_monday@2x.png 2x" />

## Week Numbers

The Date Picker has the same built-in support for Week Numbers like the Calendar. If you prefer not to show this part of the UI, simply set the Week Numbers override to ~No Symbol.

## Selection

Akin to the Calendar, the Date Picker lets you pick between three selection modes: **Single Day** limiting the user to be able to select only one date, Multiple Days allowing selection of random dates, and Range providing means to select all dates between a start and end date.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/datepicker_dropdown.png" srcset="../images/datepicker_dropdown@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/datepicker_selection.png" srcset="../images/datepicker_selection@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/datepicker_range.png" srcset="../images/datepicker_range@2x.png 2x" />

## Buttons

The Drop-down Date Picker comes with two buttons: one for closing in and keeping the current selection, and one for navigating to today. The Button area is templatable allowing you, for example, to hide a button by setting its override to ~No Symbol, or assign a different action to it. The Dialog Date Picker comes with no buttons by default because upon selecting a date, the dialog closes automatically.

## Styling

The Time Picker comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides controlling header background and title colors, as well as text colors for the selected hour, minute, and meridiem (AM/PM). The Cancel and OK buttons are Flat Buttons and can be styled accordingly.

## Usage

Show the Horizontal and Vertical Time Pickers as a dialog that dims the rest of the UI.
