# Progress

Use the Progress component to establish clarity and expectancy about the progression and completion of a task that takes longer to finish. It also works very well for scenarios where the exact time of completion is not known and when there is a larger workflow, dependent on the completion of a set of smaller tasks, such as order fulfillment or file upload/download. The Progress component is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Linear Progress Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/linear_progress.html) & [Ignite UI for Angular Circular Progress Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/circular_progress.html)

## Progress Demo

## Shape and Type

The Progress supports two layout shapes to fit the variety of use cases and layout requirements: a Circular Bar and a Linear Bar. Each of these layouts comes with an additional selection of the type of progression: Determinate and Indeterminate.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_linear.png" srcset="../images/progress_linear@2x.png 2x" />

## State

The Progress can be used in one of the following preset color combinations:

- **default**: utilizing the base primary color by default
- error: utilizing the `error` theme color to show the progress
- info: utilizing the `info` theme color to show the progress
- success: utilizing the `success` theme color to show the progress
- warn: utilizing the `warn` theme color to show the progress

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_error.png" srcset="../images/progress_error@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_info.png" srcset="../images/progress_info@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_success.png" srcset="../images/progress_success@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_warn.png" srcset="../images/progress_warn@2x.png 2x" />

## Progress Amount

When using a Determinate type of Progress, you may choose the Progress Amount between six percentage variants.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_linear-progress-amount.png" srcset="../images/progress_linear-progress-amount@2x.png 2x" />

## Stripes

When using a Linear Bar layout shape for the Progress component, it will come with an additional option for Stripes over the Fill area. To remove the Stripes, simply set the `ðŸŒˆ Stripes` color override to `transparent`.

## Styling

The Progress comes with styling flexibility through the various overrides for its text, as well as changing the colors of progress, base, stripes, fill and track where applicable.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_striped.png" srcset="../images/progress_striped@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_clear.png" srcset="../images/progress_clear@2x.png 2x" />
<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/progress_twocolor.png" srcset="../images/progress_twocolor@2x.png 2x" />

## Usage

In a Circular Bar, always use the actual value for the text label and, when adding more elaborate text in a Linear Bar, provide your best estimate for the state of completion of the task in time/files left, rather than displaying a generic string to the user. However, you may use the Indeterminate variants for both bars to display a Progress without certain and clear completion time.
