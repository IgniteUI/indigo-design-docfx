# Grid Advanced Filter

Use the Grid Advanced Filter to specify advanced filtering criteria spanning over multiple Grid columns via a dedicated dialog shown over the Grid. The Grid Advanced Filter is visually identical to [Ignite UI for Angular Grid Advanced Filtering Feature](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/grid/advanced-filtering.html)

## Advanced Filter Feature

The Grid `Advanced Filtering` component under `Grid Features` has one size and represents an overlay shown over the Grid.

## Filter Expression State

The Advanced Filter feature comes with an **Empty Filter** Expression by default that can be changed to **Applied Filter** if necessary. In Figma, to change the default empty state you need to find the `Filter Expression State` component in the layers panel and switch the `Type` property of the component from `Empty Filter` to `Applied Filter`. Once this is set up, you may customize it further by specifying desired filtering criteria.

## Toolbar

The Grid Advanced Filter is achieved by adding a Toolbar with an Advanced Filter action that enables the feature for the whole grid.
