# Icon

Use the Icon Component to provide subtle graphical information to the user that, in some cases, may also trigger simple interactions such as liking a product, saving an article for later, etc. You may choose between the already provided [Material Icons](../style/material-icons.md) or add the ones you need to the `ðŸŽ¨ Material Icons` page in the **Indigo.Design System**. The Icon is visually identical to the [Ignite UI for Angular Icon Component](https://www.infragistics.com/products/ignite-ui-angular/angular/components/icon.html)

## Icon Demo

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/icon_demo.png" srcset="../images/icon_demo@2x.png 2x" />

## Size

The Icon comes in four different sizes:

- ExtraLarge
- Large
- Medium
- Small

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/icon_sizes.png" srcset="../images/icon_sizes@2x.png 2x" />

## Styling

The Icon comes with styling flexibility through the overrides for selectable graphic and the color applied to it.

<img class="responsive-img" src="../images/icon_styling.png" srcset="../images/icon_styling@2x.png 2x" />

## Usage

Carefully pick the Icon color to assure good contrast with the background and definitely avoid similar shades of the same color or combinations that create chromatic aberrations.
