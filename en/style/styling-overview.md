# Styling Overview

The **Indigo.Design System** provides elaborate means for styling all 60+ UI components that also map to Ignite UI for Angular controls. The theming engine of Infragistics' Angular product, through powerful sass functions and mixins, allows for the creation of custom color themes that can restyle the whole product in just a few lines of code in a similar fashion. 

The Sketch library has a few pages prefixed with a 🎨 emoji that provide assets and a powerful styling infrastructure upon which the rest of the library is built:

- 🎨 Material Icons
- 🎨 Colors
- 🎨 Typography
- 🎨 Elevation
- 🎨 Illustrations

In Sketch, the colors and elevations exist as `Layer Styles`, while typography is defined as `Text Styles`, which allows you to quickly change the theme for any given design we have created with the **Indigo.Design System**.
