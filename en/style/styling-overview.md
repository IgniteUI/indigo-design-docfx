# Styling Overview

The **Indigo.Design System** provides elaborate means for styling all 60+ UI components that also map to Ignite UI for Angular controls. The theming engine in our Angular product allows for creating custom color themes that can restyle the whole product in just a few lines of code. The [**App Builder**](https://www.infragistics.com/products/appbuilder/docs/app-builder-overview) also implements these theming mechanisms to let users change the complete look of their apps with just a few clicks.

## Styling in Figma

The `Indigo.Design for Material` library in Figma, has the following structure of pages:

- â†³ Icons
- â†³ Colors
- â†³ Typography
- â†³ Elevation
- â†³ Illustrations

The listed pages are located under the `ðŸ§± Foundation` page. Ð¢he Colors and Elevations exist as `Color styles` and `Effect styles`, while Typography is defined as `Text styles`, which allows you to quickly change the theme for any given design we have created with the **Indigo.Design System**.

## Styling in Sketch

Each of the four Sketch libraries, `Indigo.Design for Material`, `Indigo.Design for Bootstrap`, `Indigo.Design for Fluent`, and `Indigo.Design for Indigo Theme`, has the same structure of pages prefixed with a ðŸŽ¨ emoji that provide assets and a powerful styling infrastructure upon which the rest of the library is built. So after you pick your variant based on the design language you prefer, head to the following pages to further customize the appearance of your library:

- ðŸŽ¨ Material Icons
- ðŸŽ¨ Colors
- ðŸŽ¨ Typography
- ðŸŽ¨ Elevation
- ðŸŽ¨ Illustrations

Ð¢he colors and elevations exist as `Layer Styles`, while typography is defined as `Text Styles`, which allows you to quickly change the theme for any given design we have created with the **Indigo.Design System**.

## Styling in Adobe XD

The Adobe XD library has a few Artboards prefixed with a ðŸŽ¨ emoji that showcase the powerful styling infrastructure upon which the rest of the library is built:

- ðŸŽ¨ Material Icons
- ðŸŽ¨ Colors
- ðŸŽ¨ Typography
- ðŸŽ¨ Elevation
- ðŸŽ¨ Illustrations

Ð¢he colors are defined as `Colors`, the typography is defined as `Character Styles`, while icons, elevation and illustrations exist as `Components`. This allows you to quickly change the theme for any given design we have created with the **Indigo.Design System**.
