# Styling Overview

The **Indigo.Design System** provides elaborate means for styling all 60+ UI components that also map to Ignite UI for Angular controls. The theming engine in our Angular product allows for creating custom color themes that can restyle the whole product in just a few lines of code. The [**App Builder**](https://www.appbuilder.dev/platform) also implements these theming mechanisms to let users change the complete look of their apps with just a few clicks.

## Styling in Figma

Each of the four Figma libraries, `Indigo.Design for Material`, `Indigo.Design for Bootstrap`, `Indigo.Design for Fluent`, and `Indigo.Design for Indigo`, has the same structure of pages that provide assets and a powerful styling infrastructure upon which the rest of the library is built. So after you pick your variant based on the design language you prefer, head to the following pages to further customize the appearance of your library:

- â†³ Icons
- â†³ Colors
- â†³ Typography
- â†³ Elevation
- â†³ Illustrations

The listed pages are located under the `ðŸ§± Foundation` page. Ð¢he Colors and Elevations exist as `Color styles` and `Effect styles`, while Typography is defined as `Text styles`, which allows you to quickly change the theme for any given design we have created with the **Indigo.Design System**.
