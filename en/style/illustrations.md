# Illustrations

On the `ðŸŽ¨ Illustrations` page of the **Indigo.Design System** you will find a collection of 17 vector graphics that let you complement your interfaces with a stylable drawing. This facilitates enhanced context of the interface layout and makes it more pleasing and complete through the presence of a key visual element.

## Changing Colors

Each illustration provides means for customization by letting you apply different colors to certain elements. It is also possible to hide an element by setting its color to transparent. Certain elements are purposefully not customizable, such as the color of a sheet of paper, however, one can still change it globally by opening the library and choosing a different one.
