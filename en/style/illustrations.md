# Illustrations

Ð¢he illustrations that come with the **Indigo.Design System** are a collection of 17 vector graphics that let you complement your interfaces with a stylable drawing. This facilitates enhanced context of the interface layout and makes it more pleasing and complete through the presence of a key visual element.

 In Figma, you can find all illustrations on a page inside the layers panel under the `ðŸ§± Foundation` category.

## Changing Colors

Each illustration provides means for customization by letting you apply different colors to certain elements. It is also possible to hide an element by setting its color to transparent. In Figma there is a full flexibility in terms of changing colors of any vector shape. You can switch the colors from the listed color styles, located inside the properties panel.
