### Run the app locally
To finally develop the app, you don't need to copy and paste code. Instead, use the generate app button in the toolbar. This quickly creates a package with your Angular application that can be downloaded. To run this app, open up the folder in an IDE like Visual Studio Code. 

* Make sure you have Node.js installed. <br>
* Then in the console, type `npm install` to install the dependencies. It may take a while to install all the necessary packages. <be>
* Once that is done, type `npm start` to compile and launch the app.<br>

The App Builder allows you to design your applications visually using professional grade Ignite UI components, and then you are able to generate the as Angular applications that you can continue developing in your IDE of choice. In the end, you are guaranteed that what you designed in the App Builder design surface looks exactly the same when the app is generated and built. Don't forget to share your feedback using the feedback button.
